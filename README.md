To play the game, launch the Main Contract // don't worry about other auxiliary contracts

you must find 9 players to start playing: 3 gods (prophet, witch, hunter), 3 wolfs, 3 normal citizens.

The unique improvement of this blockchain game is that at first all players must bid token for the roles they want to play, then the game will assign roles to each player according to the amount they bid.

From the main contract, you can get your own IPlayer, and then cast it to whoever your own role is. 

after each player has bid, call TryEndBid() to end the bidding phase and start the game.

And then play the game, chat, vote, as usual.
